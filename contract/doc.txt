7.3 Raffle System

7.3.1 How it Works

The automated raffle system operates based on user transactions, accumulating eligibility for periodic raffles.

7.3.2 Eligibility Criteria

Investors purchase exactly $25 worth of $BOAR Tokens four times in 24 hours to be eligible for the raffle.

7.3.3 Winner Selection

Raffle winners are drawn as soon as the maximum of 150 contestants is reached.

7.3.4 Raffle Payouts

50% of each $25 investment gets vested until the raffle winner is picked, while the remaining 50% goes to the investor as usual. The winner receives all vested tokens once selected.

7.3.5 Additional Raffle Details

- One entry per wallet per raffle.
- If an investor pays $25 once, twice, or three times in 24 hours without completing the fourth to qualify, the vested tokens will be returned to the investor once the 24-hour window closes.
- If an investor invests $25 more than four times in 24 hours, each transaction after qualifying for the raffle acts as a normal investment.
- Once the winner is automatically paid $7,500 in token value from the accumulated vested entry fees, the contestant list is cleared, and a new raffle begins.
